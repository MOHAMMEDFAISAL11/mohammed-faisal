1)Create Employee table and perform all the operations.
CREATE TABLE Employees(
EID NUMBER(10) NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
ENAME VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL,
EDEPT NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
E_AGE NUMBER(2) CHECK( E_AGE>19),
SAL NUMBER(6),
MGR NUMBER(3)
);
INSERT OPERATION
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(1,'FAISAL',10,23,100000,5);
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(2,'GOWTHAM',20,25,90000,1);
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(3,'ABHI',30,23,85000,1);
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(4,'RESHMA',20,23,100000,1);
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(5,'XYZ',10,23,125000,7);
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(6,'ADMIN',30,30,95000,5);
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(7,'KING',10,23,150000,1);
OR
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(&V1,'&V2'&V3,&V4,&V5);

UPDATE OPERATION
UPDATE EMP SET SAL=110000 WHERE ENAME='FAISAL';

2)Write a Query to display name, salary of all Employees ?
SELECT ENAME SAL FORM EMP;

3)Write a Query to all the details of the Employees ?
SELECT * FROM Employees;

4)Write a Query to display name of the Employee Whose salary is 5000 ?
SELECT ENAME FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE SAL=5000;

table where the ListPrice value is greater than 100 and the Color
column has a value of “Red”.
SELECT * FROM Production.Product WHERE COLOR='RED' GROUP BY COLOR HAVING MIN(VALUE)>100;
OR
SELECT * FROM Production.Product WHERE COLOR='RED' AND VALUE>100; 

6)Write a Query to display total salary of the Employee needed pay them,

 working in dept 10 also display min and max salary in that dept and 
even total number of employees working in it.
SELECT SUM(SALARY), MIN(SALARY), MAX(SALARY),NO_EMP COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE DEPT=10;
OR
SELECT DEPT,SUM(SALARY), MIN(SALARY), MAX(SALARY),NO_EMP COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE DEPT=10 GROUP BY DEPT;

BY USING FULL OUTER JOIN JOINING 3 TABLE
SELECT * FROM EMP E1 FULL OUTER JOIN (EMPDEPT E2 FULL OUTER JOIN DEPT_INFO E3 ON E2.EDEPT = E3.EDEPT)
   ON E1.EDEPT = E2.EDEPT;
